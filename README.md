# css-border-transitions

This is the link of the page I'm working on : https://www.stevenchen.uk/work-1/
If you hover over some of the items (e.g. Final Fantasy, Colege...) you can see the errors and issues at the border animation we've disscussed.
If you can help me finish this errors today I would really appreciate it and hopefully get paid sooner, which means that I can return you funds you lend me sooner.

Thanks, 

Mladen.
